## Apple bluetooth keyboard (not the newest one but the one which still has like regular batteries) bluetooth hints

Could have possibly be done via a UI but have not tried.

* Shutdown any mac that has that keyboard registered
* Enter `bluetoothctl`

```
agent KeyboardDisplay
default-agent
scan on
```

Press the side button of the keyboard until your keyboard enters pairing mode

A new device should pop-up

`[NEW] Device 28:37:37:36:75:0C 28-37-37-36-75-0C`

* Trust the keyboard
```
[bluetooth]# trust 28:37:37:36:75:0C                                                                           
[CHG] Device 28:37:37:36:75:0C Trusted: yes
Changing 28:37:37:36:75:0C trust succeeded
[CHG] Device 28:37:37:36:75:0C LegacyPairing: yes
```

* Pair the keyboard - you will have to enter the pairing code
```
[bluetooth]# pair 28:37:37:36:75:0C

[CHG] Device 28:37:37:36:75:0C Paired: yes

```

IÂ then ungeekly went to the bluetooth menu of gnome, and could see the keyboard.

The first try to bind it failed oddly, but the second time when straight in.
